-> ls -la

a file that seams interesting is in here :

"level02.pcap"

-> tcpdump -r level02.pcap

tcpdump displays the packages one by one so ...

a lot of lines appear

so from the host i'll copy the file to be able to use Wireshark

-> scp -P 22222 level02@localhost:level02.pcap level02

Now that I can check the file locally

-> strings level02.pcap | grep -i "login"

wwwbugs login: @f&NV.
Login incorrect
wwwbugs login: df&N

-> strings level02.pcap | grep -i "pass"

Password: Nf&Nat

-> su flag02

Password: 
su: Authentication failure

This is not the right way to search so
