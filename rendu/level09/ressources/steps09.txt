-> ls -la

Again two interesting lines :

-rwsr-s---+ flag08 level08 ... level08

-rw-------  flag08 flag08  ... token

-> ./level09 token

tpmhr

-> cat token

f4kmm6p|=?p?n??DB?Du{??

let's try this as the password :

-> su flag09

Password:
su: Authentication failure

-> su level10

Password:
su: Authentication failure

Let's try something else :

-> ./level09 'f4kmm6p|=pnDBDu{'

f5op:u?DxwNMP??

Ok let's try with this again. Even if it seems to easy :

-> su flag09

Password:
su: Authentication failure

-> su level10

Password:
su: Authentication failure

It doesn't work neither
