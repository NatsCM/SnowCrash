The function t(x,y) uppercases x and trims everything after the
first space, then runs egrep "^$XX" /tmp/xd to fetch lines 
starting with that prefix; for each matching line it splits the
line on : into two fields ($f,$s) and tests whether the second
field $s matches the regex provided in y ($nn) using the =~
operator â€” if a match is found it returns 1 (true), otherwise 0
(false). The web page prints .. when t(...) returns true and .
when it returns false.
